# Machine Learning Algorithms â€“ Jupyter Notebook Collection

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that walk through various machine learning algorithms using Python. The notebooks are organized into two main categories:

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Regression: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and more
  - Classification: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, etc.

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering: k-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering

Each notebook includes a step-by-step implementation, clear and beginner-friendly explanations, real-world datasets, and visualizations to help understand how each algorithm works in practice.

## Libraries Used
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn
